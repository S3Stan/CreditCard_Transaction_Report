### Fraudulent credit card analysis

_Sumary and introduction of the study_
The problem of fraudulent credit card transaction taking place is a bigger problem than most people realise it to be. The problem is not only based on the amount of money being stolen in the transactions, but more importantly the increase in the frequency or volumne of these type of transactions taking place on a daily basis. The increase in volume of these type of transactions taking place means it is very important for credit card companies to be able to identify and develop methods to decrease the number of clients that are being charged for transactions that they did not incur.

_What does this data represent?_  
The following data is credit card transaction data made by European credit card holders for a random day in September 2013. Out of the original 284,807 transactions that exist in teh dataset, a subset of 90,000 of these transactions is used in this study. 

_Purpose of analysis?_  
The purpose of this study is to create models that can be used to predict wehther a transaction is fraudulent or not using the relationships that exist within the data. To achieve this we will use regression and decison tree modelling, and then artificial neural networks.
